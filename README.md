With government policies increasingly relying on data and data analysis, **Access the Data** has identified that it is imperative to increase citizen’s access and understanding of local government data in order to be effective advocates for their communities.

Our **hypothesis** is having a centralized space for open government data and educational resources will help community activists use data to advocate for their communities.

We **envision** Access the Data as a tool that any municipality can adopt to make it easy for their citizens to find, navigate, and understand local government data.

We are **testing** this hypothesis by creating an MVP of Access the Data that includes a catalog of government data sources and open data literacy resources.
 

# Project context

Access the Data is one of a series of products being created by [Hack for LA](https://www.hackforla.org/#), a brigade of [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org/). These products are known as the [Citizen Engagement collection](https://www.hackforla.org/citizen-engagement). The collection focuses on helping the city of Los Angeles with their [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdg.lamayor.org/about/global-goals) as adopted by the [United Nations](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda).

## MVP Deliverables  

The MVP will consist of a website that hosts a catalog of open government data sources. This project will focus on Los Angeles County as its backdrop to test the hypothesis that this is a tool that community activists and data experts need and want.

# Two Week Drop-off policy
In addition to the Hack for LA [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hackforla/codeofconduct), Access the Data has a two week drop-off policy.  If the Access the Data leadership team (PMs + leads) does not receive any communication from a volunteer via team meetings, Slack, nor GitHub issues for two weeks without prior explanation and coordination, your status will be changed to “inactive”, your access to the project will be limited, and you will be unassigned from your issues.
