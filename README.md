# Data Literacy Project

Broadly, the **Data Literacy Project** was created to address the growing gaps between new technology development and decisions impacting our communities with the underlying systems and data that drive those initiatives. Near team goals of this project will be to elevate the knowledge of the LA community and members o the Neighborhood Councils around how data is collected and used to drive new technologies and policy decisions through ongoing workshops.

# Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.
