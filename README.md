**Access the Data** is an initiative aimed at identifying and addressing the areas where data literacy education within our communities is needed most. With government policies increasingly relying on data and data analysis, it becomes imperative to increase data literacy in order for citizens to be effective advocates for their communities. 

# Project context

Access the Data is working on three products:
1. A three-part educational module on using local open-source data (currently on hold)
2. A database of open data sources and resources (currently in the planning process)
3. A website to host the above educational resources (currently in production with design and development)

We also have a research team developing personas.
