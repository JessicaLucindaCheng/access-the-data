**Access the Data** is an initiative aimed at identifying and addressing the areas where data literacy education within our communities is needed most. With government policies increasingly relying on data and data analysis, it becomes imperative to increase data literacy in order for citizens to be effective advocates for their communities. 

In this spirit, Hack for LA’s Access the Data team, in partnership with the Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, Neighborhood Councils, and the Los Angeles Mayor’s office, will be developing modules to address those areas. The project will produce a website to make accessing modules and other relevant self teaching content easy.

# Project context

Access the Data is working on three products:
1. A three-part educational module on using local open-source data
2. A database of open data sources and resources
3. A website to host the above educational resources
